## Basic-Level Questions

Basic questions focus on foundational knowledge of MySQL, its architecture, and core SQL concepts. Interviewers expect clear explanations of fundamental terms and operations.

### 1. What is MySQL, and what are its key features?
**Answer**:  
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage and manipulate data stored in tables. It is known for its reliability, performance, and ease of use, making it popular for web applications, data warehousing, and more.

**Key Features**:  
- **Relational Model**: Stores data in tables with rows and columns, enforcing relationships via primary and foreign keys.  
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures reliable transactions with Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.  
- **Scalability**: Supports large datasets and high-concurrency workloads.  
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.  
- **Storage Engines**: Offers multiple engines like InnoDB (default, transactional) and MyISAM (non-transactional, fast reads).  
- **Security**: Provides user authentication, encryption, and access control.

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Briefly describe MySQL’s role in managing relational data, highlight a key feature like InnoDB’s transaction support, and mention a use case (e.g., e-commerce platforms). Keep it concise and relatable.

### 2. What is the difference between a primary key and a foreign key?
**Answer**:  
- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each row in a table. It ensures no duplicate or NULL values and is often used as the main reference for relationships.  
  **Example**: `id` column in a `users` table.  
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE users (
      id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(50)
  );
  ```
- **Foreign Key**: A column (or set of columns) in one table that references the primary key of another table, enforcing referential integrity.  
  **Example**: `user_id` in an `orders` table referencing `id` in `users`.  
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE orders (
      order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      user_id INT,
      FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
  );
  ```

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Explain both concepts with a clear example, emphasize referential integrity for foreign keys, and mention constraints (e.g., `ON DELETE CASCADE`). Use a simple analogy (e.g., primary key as a unique ID card number) if needed.

### 3. What are the differences between `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, and `DROP` in MySQL?
**Answer**:  
| **Command** | **Purpose** | **Impact** | **Rollback** | **Structure** |
|-------------|-------------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| **DELETE**  | Removes specific rows based on a condition | Affects data only; triggers apply | Can be rolled back in transactions | Table structure remains |
| **TRUNCATE**| Removes all rows, resets auto-increment | Affects data only; faster than DELETE | Cannot be rolled back | Table structure remains |
| **DROP**    | Deletes the entire table or database | Removes data and structure | Cannot be rolled back | Nothing remains |

**Example**:
```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE age < 18; -- Removes specific rows
TRUNCATE TABLE users; -- Clears all rows, resets auto-increment
DROP TABLE users; -- Deletes table entirely
```

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Present a comparison table or list, highlight performance differences (e.g., `TRUNCATE` is faster), and mention use cases (e.g., `DELETE` for selective removal). Address transaction safety to show depth.

## Intermediate-Level Questions

Intermediate questions test your ability to apply MySQL in practical scenarios, including complex queries, indexing, and transactions.

### 4. How do you perform CRUD operations in MySQL?
**Answer**:  
MySQL supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations using SQL statements.

- **Create**: Insert data using `INSERT`.  
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 25);
  ```
- **Read**: Retrieve data using `SELECT`.  
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE age >= 20;
  ```
- **Update**: Modify data using `UPDATE`.  
  ```sql
  UPDATE users SET age = 26 WHERE name = 'Alice';
  ```
- **Delete**: Remove data using `DELETE`.  
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM users WHERE name = 'Alice';
  ```

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Provide examples for each operation, explain clauses like `WHERE` or `SET`, and mention error handling (e.g., checking affected rows). Be prepared to write queries on a whiteboard and discuss query optimization.

### 5. What is indexing, and how does it improve query performance?
**Answer**:  
An index is a database structure that improves the speed of data retrieval by creating a lookup mechanism for specific columns. MySQL uses B-Tree (default) or Hash indexes to reduce the number of rows scanned during queries.

**Types of Indexes**:  
- **Primary Index**: Automatically created for primary keys.  
- **Unique Index**: Ensures unique values (e.g., email addresses).  
- **Composite Index**: Covers multiple columns (e.g., `INDEX(name, age)`).  
- **Full-Text Index**: For text search in large datasets.  

**Example**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON users(name);
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Alice'; -- Uses index for faster lookup
```

**Importance**:  
- Speeds up `SELECT`, `JOIN`, and `WHERE` clauses.  
- Reduces disk I/O and CPU usage.  

**Trade-offs**:  
- Indexes consume storage space.  
- Slows down `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` due to index updates.

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Explain indexing with an analogy (e.g., a book’s index), provide a code example, and discuss trade-offs. Mention `EXPLAIN` to analyze query plans and show practical knowledge.

### 6. What are JOINs in MySQL, and how do they work?
**Answer**:  
JOINs combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column, typically a primary key and foreign key.

**Types of JOINs**:  
- **INNER JOIN**: Returns rows where there is a match in both tables.  
- **LEFT (OUTER) JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table, with NULLs for non-matching rows in the right table.  
- **RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN**: Returns all rows from the right table, with NULLs for non-matching rows in the left table.  
- **FULL (OUTER) JOIN**: Returns all rows from both tables, with NULLs for non-matches (MySQL simulates this using `UNION`).  

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT u.name, o.order_id
FROM users u
INNER JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;
```

**Output** (for matching rows):
| name  | order_id |
|-------|----------|
| Alice | 1        |
| Bob   | 2        |

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Provide a clear example with a diagram or table, explain the difference between INNER and OUTER JOINs, and mention performance considerations (e.g., indexing join columns). Be ready to write a JOIN query.

## Advanced-Level Questions

Advanced questions assess deep knowledge of MySQL’s internals, performance optimization, and complex scenarios like replication or stored procedures.

### 7. What are transactions in MySQL, and how do you use them?
**Answer**:  
A transaction is a sequence of SQL operations treated as a single unit, ensuring ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). Transactions are critical for maintaining data integrity in multi-step operations (e.g., bank transfers).

**Key Commands**:  
- `START TRANSACTION`: Begins a transaction.  
- `COMMIT`: Saves changes permanently.  
- `ROLLBACK`: Reverts changes if an error occurs.  

**Example**:
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE user_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE user_id = 2;
COMMIT; -- Or ROLLBACK if an error occurs
```

**Isolation Levels** (InnoDB):  
- **READ UNCOMMITTED**: Allows dirty reads.  
- **READ COMMITTED**: Prevents dirty reads.  
- **REPEATABLE READ**: Prevents non-repeatable reads (default).  
- **SERIALIZABLE**: Strictest, prevents phantom reads.  

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Explain ACID properties, provide a practical example (e.g., financial transactions), and mention isolation levels to show depth. Discuss error handling with try-catch in application code.

### 8. What is replication in MySQL, and how does it work?
**Answer**:  
Replication is a process where data from a primary (master) MySQL server is copied to one or more secondary (slave) servers, ensuring high availability, load balancing, and disaster recovery.

**Types**:  
- **Asynchronous Replication**: Primary writes data, and secondaries replicate asynchronously via binary logs.  
- **Semi-Synchronous Replication**: Primary waits for at least one secondary to acknowledge before committing.  
- **Group Replication**: Multi-primary setup for fault tolerance (MySQL 8.0+).

**How It Works**:  
- The primary server logs changes in its **binary log**.  
- Secondaries read the binary log via an **I/O thread** and apply changes using a **SQL thread**.  
- **Relay Log**: Temporary storage on secondaries for replication events.  

**Example Configuration** (my.cnf on primary):
```ini
[mysqld]
server-id=1
log-bin=mysql-bin
```

**Use Cases**:  
- Read-heavy applications (direct reads to secondaries).  
- Backup and failover systems.

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Describe the replication process, mention binary logs and server IDs, and discuss use cases (e.g., scaling reads). Address challenges like replication lag and conflict resolution.

### 9. How do you optimize slow queries in MySQL?
**Answer**:  
Optimizing slow queries involves analyzing and improving query execution plans, indexing, and database design.

**Steps**:  
1. **Identify Slow Queries**: Use the Slow Query Log or `SHOW PROCESSLIST` to find problematic queries.  
2. **Analyze with EXPLAIN**: Inspect the query plan to identify full table scans or missing indexes.  
   ```sql
   EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Alice';
   ```
3. **Add Indexes**: Create indexes on frequently queried columns (e.g., `WHERE`, `JOIN`, or `ORDER BY` columns).  
4. **Optimize Query Structure**:  
   - Avoid `SELECT *`; specify needed columns.  
   - Use `LIMIT` for paginated results.  
   - Simplify complex subqueries with JOINs.  
5. **Use Proper Data Types**: Choose efficient types (e.g., `INT` over `VARCHAR` for IDs).  
6. **Partition Large Tables**: Split tables into smaller chunks for faster access.  
7. **Cache Results**: Use MySQL Query Cache (older versions) or application-level caching (e.g., Redis).  

**Example**:
```sql
-- Before: Slow due to full table scan
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 101;
-- After: Add index
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON orders(customer_id);
```

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Walk through a step-by-step optimization process, emphasize `EXPLAIN`, and provide a before-and-after example. Mention tools like MySQL Workbench or Percona Toolkit for advanced analysis.
