---

## Basic-Level Questions

Basic questions focus on foundational knowledge of Node.js, its architecture, and core concepts. Interviewers expect clear explanations of fundamental terms and operations.

### 1. What is Node.js, and what are its key features?
**Answer**:  
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 engine, designed for executing JavaScript code outside the browser, primarily for server-side development. It enables building fast, scalable, and event-driven applications.

**Key Features**:  
- **Asynchronous and Non-Blocking**: Uses an event-driven, single-threaded event loop for handling concurrent operations efficiently.  
- **V8 Engine**: Compiles JavaScript to native machine code for high performance.  
- **Module System**: Supports CommonJS (default) and ES Modules for organizing code.  
- **NPM**: Node Package Manager provides a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools.  
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.  
- **Scalability**: Ideal for I/O-heavy applications like APIs, real-time apps, and microservices.

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Briefly describe Node.js’s role in server-side development, highlight its non-blocking nature, and mention a use case (e.g., REST APIs). Use simple terms and connect it to real-world applications.

---

### 2. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in Node.js?
**Answer**:  
- **Synchronous Code**: Executes sequentially, blocking further execution until the current operation completes. Suitable for CPU-intensive tasks but can slow down performance.  
  **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const fs = require('fs');
  const data = fs.readFileSync('file.txt', 'utf8'); // Blocks until file is read
  console.log(data);
  ```
- **Asynchronous Code**: Executes non-blocking operations, allowing the program to continue while waiting for I/O tasks (e.g., file reading, HTTP requests). Uses callbacks, Promises, or async/await.  
  **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const fs = require('fs');
  fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(data);
  });
  console.log('This runs first'); // Non-blocking
  ```

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Provide clear examples of both, emphasize Node.js’s strength in asynchronous I/O, and mention practical scenarios (e.g., async for database queries). Keep it concise and show code if possible.

---

### 3. What is the Event Loop in Node.js?
**Answer**:  
The Event Loop is a core component of Node.js that enables its non-blocking, asynchronous behavior. It manages the execution of asynchronous tasks in a single-threaded environment by processing the call stack, task queue, and microtask queue.

**How It Works**:  
1. **Call Stack**: Executes synchronous code.  
2. **Web APIs**: Offloads asynchronous tasks (e.g., `setTimeout`, HTTP requests) to the browser or C++ APIs.  
3. **Task Queue**: Stores callbacks for completed asynchronous tasks (e.g., `setTimeout` callbacks).  
4. **Microtask Queue**: Stores Promise resolutions and other high-priority tasks.  
5. **Event Loop**: Continuously checks the call stack; if empty, it processes microtasks first, then tasks from the task queue.

**Example**:
```javascript
console.log('Start');
setTimeout(() => console.log('Timeout'), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('Promise'));
console.log('End');
// Output: Start, End, Promise, Timeout
```

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Explain the Event Loop’s role in handling concurrency, use a diagram or step-by-step flow if possible, and clarify the priority of microtasks over tasks. Relate it to real-world scenarios like API handling.

## Intermediate-Level Questions

Intermediate questions test your ability to apply Node.js in practical scenarios, including modules, middleware, and error handling.

### 4. What are modules in Node.js, and how do you use them?
**Answer**:  
Modules in Node.js are reusable blocks of code encapsulated in separate files, promoting modularity and maintainability. Node.js supports **CommonJS** (default) and **ES Modules**.

- **CommonJS**: Uses `require()` to import and `module.exports` to export.  
  **Example**:
  ```javascript
  // math.js
  module.exports = {
    add: (a, b) => a + b
  };

  // app.js
  const math = require('./math');
  console.log(math.add(2, 3)); // 5
  ```
- **ES Modules**: Uses `import` and `export` (requires `"type": "module"` in `package.json`).  
  **Example**:
  ```javascript
  // math.mjs
  export const add = (a, b) => a + b;

  // app.mjs
  import { add } from './math.mjs';
  console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
  ```

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Demonstrate both CommonJS and ES Modules with examples, explain the `require` resolution process, and mention the benefits of modularity (e.g., code organization). Be ready to discuss module caching.

### 5. What is middleware in Express, and how does it work?
**Answer**:  
Middleware in Express is a function that processes HTTP requests and responses in the request-response cycle. It has access to the request (`req`), response (`res`), and the `next` function to pass control to the next middleware.

**Types**:  
- **Application-level**: Applied globally (e.g., logging).  
- **Router-level**: Applied to specific routes.  
- **Error-handling**: Handles errors (requires four arguments: `err`, `req`, `res`, `next`).  

**Example**:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware for logging
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
});

// Route-specific middleware
const auth = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.query.admin === 'true') next();
  else res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
};

// Error-handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something went wrong!');
});

app.get('/admin', auth, (req, res) => {
  res.send('Admin Page');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Explain middleware’s role in request processing, provide a practical example (e.g., authentication), and highlight the importance of `next()`. Discuss real-world use cases like logging or error handling.

---

### 6. How do you handle errors in Node.js applications?
**Answer**:  
Error handling in Node.js ensures robust applications by managing synchronous and asynchronous errors effectively.

**Techniques**:  
- **Synchronous Errors**: Use try-catch blocks.  
  ```javascript
  try {
    const data = JSON.parse(invalidJson);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Parse error:', err.message);
  }
  ```
- **Asynchronous Errors (Callbacks)**: Pass errors to callbacks.  
  ```javascript
  const fs = require('fs');
  fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {
    if (err) return console.error(err);
    console.log(data);
  });
  ```
- **Promises**: Use `.catch()` or try-catch with async/await.  
  ```javascript
  async function readFile() {
    try {
      const data = await fs.promises.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8');
      console.log(data);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err);
    }
  }
  ```
- **Express Error Handling**: Use error-handling middleware.  
  ```javascript
  app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
  });
  ```

**Best Practices**:  
- Log errors for debugging (e.g., using Winston or Morgan).  
- Use custom error classes for specific error types.  
- Gracefully handle uncaught exceptions with `process.on('uncaughtException')`.

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Provide examples for different error types, emphasize structured error handling in Express, and mention logging or monitoring tools. Be prepared to write error-handling code.

## Advanced-Level Questions

Advanced questions assess deep knowledge of Node.js internals, performance optimization, and complex scenarios like clustering or streams.

### 7. What is the difference between `process.nextTick` and `setImmediate`?
**Answer**:  
Both `process.nextTick` and `setImmediate` schedule callbacks in Node.js, but they differ in timing and priority within the Event Loop.

- **`process.nextTick`**: Adds the callback to the **nextTick queue**, executed **before** the Event Loop continues (before I/O tasks or timers). High priority, can starve I/O if overused.  
  **Example**:
  ```javascript
  process.nextTick(() => console.log('Next Tick'));
  console.log('Immediate');
  // Output: Immediate, Next Tick
  ```
- **`setImmediate`**: Adds the callback to the **check phase** of the Event Loop, executed **after** I/O tasks but before timers. Lower priority, safer for I/O-bound tasks.  
  **Example**:
  ```javascript
  setImmediate(() => console.log('Immediate'));
  process.nextTick(() => console.log('Next Tick'));
  // Output: Next Tick, Immediate
  ```

**Use Cases**:  
- Use `process.nextTick` for critical, synchronous-like tasks (e.g., resolving Promises).  
- Use `setImmediate` for deferring non-critical tasks without blocking I/O.

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Explain their place in the Event Loop phases, provide a clear example, and discuss risks (e.g., `nextTick` recursion). Use a diagram if possible to illustrate priority.

### 8. What are Streams in Node.js, and how are they used?
**Answer**:  
Streams are objects in Node.js for handling large data (e.g., files, network data) in chunks, improving memory efficiency and performance. They are EventEmitter instances that process data sequentially.

**Types of Streams**:  
- **Readable**: Read data (e.g., `fs.createReadStream`).  
- **Writable**: Write data (e.g., `fs.createWriteStream`).  
- **Duplex**: Both readable and writable (e.g., TCP sockets).  
- **Transform**: Modifies data while streaming (e.g., compression).  

**Example** (Reading a file and writing to another):
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const readStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt', 'utf8');
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

readStream.pipe(writeStream); // Pipes data from readable to writable
readStream.on('end', () => console.log('Streaming complete'));
```

**Benefits**:  
- Memory-efficient for large files (processes chunks, not entire file).  
- Enables real-time processing (e.g., streaming video).  

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Explain streams with a practical example (e.g., file streaming), highlight `pipe()` for chaining, and compare to non-streaming approaches (e.g., `readFile`). Mention backpressure handling for advanced scenarios.

### 9. How does the Cluster module improve Node.js performance?
**Answer**:  
The Cluster module in Node.js enables a single Node.js process to utilize multiple CPU cores by creating worker processes that share the same server port. This improves performance for CPU-bound or high-concurrency applications.

**How It Works**:  
- **Master Process**: Creates and manages worker processes, typically one per CPU core.  
- **Worker Processes**: Run independent instances of the application, handling requests in parallel.  
- **Load Balancing**: The master distributes incoming connections among workers (round-robin by default).

**Example**:
```javascript
const cluster = require('cluster');
const http = require('http');
const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  console.log(`Master ${process.pid} is running`);
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork(); // Create worker
  }
} else {
  http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end(`Worker ${process.pid} handled this`);
  }).listen(8000);
  console.log(`Worker ${process.pid} started`);
}
```

**When to Use**:  
- For CPU-intensive tasks or high-traffic servers.  
- Not ideal for I/O-bound tasks, as Node.js’s Event Loop already handles concurrency well.

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Explain the Cluster module’s role in scaling, provide a code example, and discuss limitations (e.g., shared state challenges). Mention PM2 for production clustering.
