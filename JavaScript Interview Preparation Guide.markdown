## Basic-Level Questions

Basic questions test your understanding of JavaScript fundamentals. Interviewers expect clear, concise answers demonstrating a solid grasp of core concepts.

### 1. What is JavaScript, and what are its key features?
**Answer**:  
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for adding interactivity to web pages. It runs in browsers and supports server-side development (e.g., Node.js).  

**Key Features**:  
- **Dynamic Typing**: Variables can hold any data type without explicit declaration.  
- **Prototype-Based Object-Oriented**: Uses prototypes for inheritance.  
- **First-Class Functions**: Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or returned.  
- **Event-Driven**: Supports asynchronous programming with event loops and callbacks.  
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on browsers, servers, and devices.

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Explain JavaScript’s role in web development and mention its versatility (client and server-side). Use simple terms and highlight a feature like asynchronous programming to show depth.

### 2. What are the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`?
**Answer**:  
- **`var`**: Function-scoped, can be redeclared and reassigned. Hoisted with `undefined` initialization. Prone to errors due to global scope leaks.  
- **`let`**: Block-scoped, can be reassigned but not redeclared in the same scope. Hoisted but not initialized (causes ReferenceError in Temporal Dead Zone).  
- **`const`**: Block-scoped, cannot be reassigned or redeclared. Must be initialized at declaration. Note: Objects/arrays declared with `const` can have their properties/elements modified.

**Example**:
```javascript
var x = 1;
var x = 2; // Allowed
let y = 1;
y = 2; // Allowed
const z = 1;
// z = 2; // Error: Assignment to constant
```

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Provide a clear comparison table or list, emphasize block-scoping for `let` and `const`, and mention practical use cases (e.g., use `const` for immutable bindings). Address hoisting briefly to show understanding.

### 3. What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
**Answer**:  
- **`undefined`**: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value. It’s the default value for uninitialized variables, function arguments, or return values.  
- **`null`**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It must be explicitly assigned.  

**Example**:
```javascript
let a;
console.log(a); // undefined
let b = null;
console.log(b); // null
console.log(typeof null); // "object" (historical bug)
console.log(typeof undefined); // "undefined"
```

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Clarify the distinction with examples, mention the `typeof` quirk for `null`, and explain when to use `null` (e.g., resetting an object reference). Keep it concise but precise.

---

## Intermediate-Level Questions

Intermediate questions assess your ability to apply JavaScript in practical scenarios, including closures, asynchronous programming, and DOM manipulation.

### 4. What is a closure, and how is it used?
**Answer**:  
A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope’s variables even after the outer function has finished executing. Closures are created when an inner function references variables from its outer function.

**Example**:
```javascript
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}
const counter = outer();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
```

**Use Cases**:  
- Data privacy (e.g., module pattern).  
- State management (e.g., counters, event handlers).  
- Partial application or currying.

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Explain the concept with a simple example, highlight how the inner function “closes over” the outer scope, and mention a real-world use case (e.g., event listeners). Be prepared to write code on a whiteboard.

### 5. Explain the Event Loop and how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations.
**Answer**:  
JavaScript is single-threaded, using an **Event Loop** to handle asynchronous operations. The Event Loop manages the call stack, task queue, and microtask queue to process synchronous and asynchronous tasks.

**Process**:  
1. Synchronous code executes on the call stack.  
2. Asynchronous tasks (e.g., `setTimeout`, Promises) are offloaded to Web APIs (e.g., timers, HTTP requests).  
3. When the API completes, its callback is placed in the task queue (or microtask queue for Promises).  
4. The Event Loop checks the call stack; if empty, it moves tasks from the microtask queue (first) or task queue to the stack for execution.

**Example**:
```javascript
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise"));
console.log("End");
// Output: Start, End, Promise, Timeout
```

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Use a diagram or step-by-step explanation if possible. Emphasize the priority of microtasks (Promises) over tasks (`setTimeout`). Relate it to real-world scenarios like API calls or event handling.

### 6. What is the difference between `call`, `apply`, and `bind`?
**Answer**:  
These methods control the value of `this` in a function and allow argument passing.  

- **`call`**: Invokes the function immediately, setting `this` to the provided value and passing arguments individually.  
- **`apply`**: Similar to `call`, but arguments are passed as an array.  
- **`bind`**: Returns a new function with `this` permanently bound to the provided value. Does not invoke immediately.

**Example**:
```javascript
const obj = { name: "Alice" };
function greet(greeting) {
  console.log(`${greeting}, ${this.name}`);
}
greet.call(obj, "Hello"); // Hello, Alice
greet.apply(obj, ["Hi"]); // Hi, Alice
const boundGreet = greet.bind(obj);
boundGreet("Hey"); // Hey, Alice
```

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Demonstrate with a practical example, highlight the array-based argument passing for `apply`, and clarify that `bind` is useful for event handlers or delayed execution.

## Advanced-Level Questions

Advanced questions test deep knowledge of JavaScript internals, performance optimization, and complex scenarios like module systems or memory management.

### 7. What are Promises, and how do they compare to async/await?
**Answer**:  
**Promises** are objects representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. They have three states: `pending`, `fulfilled`, or `rejected`.  

**Example**:
```javascript
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve("Success"), 1000);
});
promise.then(result => console.log(result)); // Success
```

**Async/Await**: Syntactic sugar over Promises, making asynchronous code look synchronous.  
- `async` functions return a Promise.  
- `await` pauses execution until the Promise resolves.

**Example**:
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const result = await new Promise(resolve => {
      setTimeout(() => resolve("Success"), 1000);
    });
    console.log(result); // Success
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
fetchData();
```

**Comparison**:  
- **Promises**: Use `.then`/`.catch` chaining, can be verbose for complex flows.  
- **Async/Await**: Cleaner syntax, easier error handling with try/catch, better for sequential async operations.  
- **Use Case**: Use Promises for simple tasks or parallel execution (`Promise.all`). Use async/await for readable, linear async code.

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Show both syntaxes with examples, explain error handling, and mention performance considerations (e.g., `Promise.all` for parallel tasks). Be ready to discuss chaining vs. nesting.

### 8. What is the Module Pattern, and how does it achieve data privacy?
**Answer**:  
The Module Pattern is a design pattern that uses an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) to create a private scope, exposing only a public API. It achieves data privacy by keeping variables inside the IIFE’s closure, inaccessible from the outside.

**Example**:
```javascript
const myModule = (function () {
  let privateVar = 0; // Private
  function privateFunction() {
    return privateVar++;
  }
  return {
    publicMethod() {
      return privateFunction();
    }
  };
})();
console.log(myModule.publicMethod()); // 0
console.log(myModule.publicMethod()); // 1
// console.log(myModule.privateVar); // undefined
```

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Walk through the code, emphasizing the closure and IIFE. Compare it to modern ES Modules (`import/export`) and explain its relevance in legacy code or non-module environments.

### 9. How does JavaScript handle memory management, and what is a memory leak?
**Answer**:  
JavaScript uses **automatic memory management** with a **garbage collector** (typically Mark-and-Sweep algorithm):  
- Objects are allocated memory when created.  
- The garbage collector identifies unreachable objects (no references) and deallocates their memory.  

**Memory Leak**: Occurs when memory is not released, causing increased memory usage. Common causes:  
- Unintended global variables.  
- Forgotten timers or event listeners.  
- Closures holding references to unused objects.

**Example of a Leak**:
```javascript
function createLeak() {
  const bigArray = new Array(10000).fill("data");
  setInterval(() => {
    console.log(bigArray); // bigArray is never released
  }, 1000);
}
```

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Explain the garbage collection process briefly, provide a clear example of a memory leak, and suggest mitigation (e.g., clearing intervals with `clearInterval` or removing event listeners). Mention tools like Chrome DevTools for debugging.

## Tips for Answering Confidently

1. **Structure Your Answer**: Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for behavioral questions or a clear explanation-example-application flow for technical questions.  
2. **Write Code**: Practice writing clean, error-free code on a whiteboard or in a code editor. Explain your thought process while coding.  
3. **Ask Clarifying Questions**: If a question is ambiguous (e.g., “Optimize this code”), ask about constraints (e.g., time vs. space complexity).  
4. **Admit Knowledge Gaps Gracefully**: If unsure, say, “I’m not fully familiar with that, but I’d approach it by…” and pivot to a related concept.  
5. **Practice Common Problems**: Solve problems on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank, focusing on array manipulation, string processing, and asynchronous coding.

## Common Question Types and How to Prepare

1. **Conceptual Questions**: Study core concepts (e.g., hoisting, scope, this). Use resources like MDN Web Docs or “You Don’t Know JS” books.  
2. **Coding Problems**: Practice problems like reversing a string, finding duplicates, or implementing debounce/throttle.  
3. **Debugging**: Be ready to spot errors in code snippets (e.g., incorrect `this` binding or async issues).  
4. **System Design**: For senior roles, understand JavaScript’s role in front-end architecture (e.g., component-based design with React).  
5. **Behavioral Questions**: Prepare stories showcasing problem-solving, teamwork, or learning new JavaScript features.
