## Basic-Level Questions

Basic questions focus on foundational knowledge of Express, its purpose, and core concepts. Interviewers expect clear explanations of fundamental features and basic usage.

### 1. What is Express, and what are its key features?
**Answer**:  
Express is a minimal, flexible web application framework for Node.js that simplifies building server-side applications and APIs. It provides a robust set of features for handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and rendering views.

**Key Features**:  
- **Routing**: Defines endpoints to handle HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST).  
- **Middleware**: Functions that process requests and responses, enabling tasks like logging, authentication, or parsing.  
- **Template Engines**: Supports rendering dynamic HTML with engines like Pug or EJS.  
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms for handling errors gracefully.  
- **Extensibility**: Integrates with databases, ORMs, and other Node.js modules via npm.  
- **Performance**: Lightweight and built on Node.js’s asynchronous model.

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Briefly explain Express’s role in simplifying Node.js development, highlight middleware or routing, and mention a use case (e.g., building REST APIs). Keep it concise and connect to practical applications.

### 2. How do you set up a basic Express server?
**Answer**:  
To set up an Express server, install Express, create an instance, define routes, and start the server.

**Example**:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Basic route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

// Start server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

**Steps**:  
1. Install Express: `npm install express`.  
2. Create an Express instance: `const app = express()`.  
3. Define routes using HTTP methods (e.g., `app.get()`).  
4. Start the server with `app.listen()`.

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Provide a simple, working code example, explain each part (e.g., `req` and `res` objects), and mention the need for `npm install`. Be prepared to write this code on a whiteboard.

---

### 3. What is middleware in Express, and how is it used?
**Answer**:  
Middleware in Express is a function that executes during the request-response cycle, with access to the request (`req`), response (`res`), and `next` function to pass control to the next middleware or route handler.

**Types**:  
- **Application-level**: Applied globally to all routes.  
- **Router-level**: Applied to specific routes or routers.  
- **Error-handling**: Handles errors (takes four arguments: `err`, `req`, `res`, `next`).  
- **Built-in**: Provided by Express (e.g., `express.json()`).  
- **Third-party**: External modules (e.g., `body-parser`, `morgan`).

**Example**:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Application-level middleware (logging)
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
});

// Route-specific middleware
const auth = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.query.admin === 'true') next();
  else res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
};

app.get('/admin', auth, (req, res) => {
  res.send('Admin Dashboard');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Explain middleware’s role in request processing, provide a clear example (e.g., logging or authentication), and emphasize the importance of `next()`. Mention real-world use cases like parsing JSON or securing routes.

---

## Intermediate-Level Questions

Intermediate questions test your ability to apply Express in practical scenarios, including routing, error handling, and integration with databases.

### 4. How do you handle routing in Express?
**Answer**:  
Routing in Express defines how the application responds to client requests for specific endpoints and HTTP methods. Routes can be defined for individual paths or grouped using `express.Router`.

**Example** (Basic Routing):
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Home Page');
});

app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Create User');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

**Example** (Using Router):
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const userRouter = express.Router();

// Define routes in a router
userRouter.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('List Users');
});
userRouter.get('/:id', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`User ${req.params.id}`);
});

// Mount router
app.use('/users', userRouter);

app.listen(3000);
```

**Features**:  
- **Dynamic Parameters**: Access via `req.params` (e.g., `/users/:id`).  
- **Query Parameters**: Access via `req.query` (e.g., `/search?term=express`).  
- **HTTP Methods**: Supports `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, etc.  

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Demonstrate both basic routes and `Router` usage, explain dynamic parameters, and highlight modularity with `Router`. Be ready to write a RESTful route structure (e.g., `/users/:id`).

### 5. How do you handle errors in Express applications?
**Answer**:  
Express provides built-in error-handling middleware to manage errors during request processing. Error-handling middleware requires four arguments (`err`, `req`, `res`, `next`) and is typically placed at the end of the middleware stack.

**Example**:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  throw new Error('Something went wrong!'); // Synchronous error
});

// Error-handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
});

app.listen(3000);
```

**Asynchronous Errors**:
```javascript
app.get('/data', async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const data = await someAsyncFunction();
    res.json(data);
  } catch (err) {
    next(err); // Pass error to error-handling middleware
  }
});
```

**Best Practices**:  
- Use try-catch for async operations.  
- Define custom error classes for specific error types.  
- Log errors using tools like Winston or Morgan.  
- Return consistent error responses (e.g., JSON format).

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Provide examples for synchronous and asynchronous errors, explain the role of `next(err)`, and mention logging or monitoring tools. Be prepared to write error-handling code.

### 6. How do you parse request bodies in Express?
**Answer**:  
Express provides built-in middleware to parse incoming request bodies, such as JSON or form data, making the data available in `req.body`.

**Example**:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Parse JSON bodies
app.use(express.json());

// Parse URL-encoded form data
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body); // { name: 'Alice', age: 25 }
  res.json(req.body);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

**Key Middleware**:  
- `express.json()`: Parses JSON payloads (e.g., `Content-Type: application/json`).  
- `express.urlencoded()`: Parses URL-encoded data (e.g., HTML form submissions).  
- **Third-Party**: `multer` for handling file uploads (`multipart/form-data`).

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Demonstrate `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()` with an example, explain `req.body` access, and mention `multer` for file uploads if relevant. Clarify the `extended: true` option for nested objects.

## Advanced-Level Questions

Advanced questions assess deep knowledge of Express internals, performance optimization, and complex scenarios like authentication or scalability.

### 7. What is the difference between `app.use` and `app.get` (or other HTTP methods)?
**Answer**:  
- **`app.use`**: Registers middleware that executes for **all HTTP methods** and routes (or a specific path prefix). It’s used for tasks like logging, parsing, or authentication.  
  **Example**:
  ```javascript
  app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Middleware for all requests');
    next();
  });
  ```
- **`app.get` (or `app.post`, etc.)**: Defines a route handler for a **specific HTTP method** and path. It’s used for handling specific endpoints.  
  **Example**:
  ```javascript
  app.get('/home', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Home Page');
  });
  ```

**Key Differences**:  
- **Scope**: `app.use` applies to all methods; `app.get` is method-specific.  
- **Purpose**: `app.use` for middleware (cross-cutting concerns); `app.get` for route-specific logic.  
- **Order**: Middleware (`app.use`) runs before route handlers in the order defined.

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Provide examples of both, explain their roles in the request pipeline, and highlight middleware’s flexibility. Mention mounting middleware on specific paths (e.g., `app.use('/api', middleware)`).

### 8. How do you implement authentication in an Express application?
**Answer**:  
Authentication in Express can be implemented using middleware, JSON Web Tokens (JWT), or third-party libraries like Passport.js. A common approach is JWT-based authentication.

**Example** (JWT Authentication):
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const SECRET_KEY = 'your-secret-key';

// Middleware to verify JWT
const authenticateToken = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers['authorization']?.split(' ')[1];
  if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Token required' });

  jwt.verify(token, SECRET_KEY, (err, user) => {
    if (err) return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });
    req.user = user;
    next();
  });
};

// Login route to generate JWT
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  const { username } = req.body;
  const user = { id: 1, username }; // Mock user
  const token = jwt.sign(user, SECRET_KEY, { expiresIn: '1h' });
  res.json({ token });
});

// Protected route
app.get('/protected', authenticateToken, (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Protected data', user: req.user });
});

app.listen(3000);
```

**Steps**:  
1. Generate a JWT on login using `jwt.sign`.  
2. Verify the token in a middleware using `jwt.verify`.  
3. Attach user data to `req` for use in protected routes.

**Alternatives**:  
- **Passport.js**: For OAuth, local, or social logins.  
- **Session-based**: Store sessions in memory or databases (e.g., `express-session`).  

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
Walk through the JWT example, explain token verification, and discuss security practices (e.g., secure `SECRET_KEY`, HTTPS). Mention Passport.js for complex scenarios.

### 9. How do you optimize an Express application for performance?
**Answer**:  
Optimizing an Express application involves improving response times, reducing resource usage, and handling high concurrency.

**Techniques**:  
1. **Use Compression**: Reduce response size with `compression` middleware.  
   ```javascript
   const compression = require('compression');
   app.use(compression());
   ```
2. **Enable Caching**: Use in-memory caches (e.g., Redis) or HTTP caching (e.g., `ETag`, `Cache-Control`).  
   ```javascript
   app.set('etag', 'strong');
   ```
3. **Optimize Middleware**: Minimize middleware usage and place heavy middleware (e.g., authentication) only on necessary routes.  
4. **Asynchronous Code**: Use async/await or Promises to avoid blocking the Event Loop.  
   ```javascript
   app.get('/data', async (req, res) => {
     const data = await db.query();
     res.json(data);
   });
   ```
5. **Load Balancing**: Use Node.js Cluster module or external tools like PM2/Nginx to distribute requests.  
6. **Database Optimization**: Index database queries and use connection pooling (e.g., `mysql2/promise`).  
7. **Profiling**: Use tools like `clinic.js` or `New Relic` to identify bottlenecks.

**How to Answer Confidently**:  
List specific techniques with examples, focus on middleware and async code, and mention tools like PM2 or Redis. Discuss trade-offs (e.g., caching vs. data freshness). Be ready to explain a real-world optimization scenario.
